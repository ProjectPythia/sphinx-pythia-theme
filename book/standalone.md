# Standalone Pages

*Standalone* pages are pages that don't have the PyData Sphinx Theme's `topbar`
nor any sidebar navigation.  They are rendered like sections in the *Banner*-style
layout.  Like the *Banner* layout, titles in the *Standalone* layout are all
created with `div` elements containing a Bootstrap `display` class.

## Sections

Sections in the *Standalone* layout have nice spacing and decorations to make theme
stand out, without conforming to the *Banner* style layout.  Background colors are
not changed and spacing is meant to imply that the section content is intended to be
read as a single page.

### Subsections

And subsections are displayed like this!
