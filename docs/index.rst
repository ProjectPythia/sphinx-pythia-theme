This is the Sphinx Pythia Theme, a Sphinx theme for use with Jupyter Books.
The Sphinx Pythia Theme inherits from the Sphinx Book Theme, which is used
by default in Jupyter Books.  It can be used on its own, outside of a Jupyter
Book, however, just like the Sphinx Book Theme, itself.

Beyond Sphinx Book Theme
------------------------

The Sphinx Pythia Theme adds some new features to the existing features
provided by the Sphinx Book Theme and the PyData Sphinx Theme, upon which the
Sphinx Book Theme is built.

Banner Layouts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One new feature is the use of alternate layouts for main pages, such as
the **banner** layout.  The banner layout converts all *titles* and *sections*
(i.e., ``#`` and ``##`` blocks) into *banners* that are full-width, have plenty
of padding (to separate them from the other content), and allow you to specify
background colors and images for the banner sections.

The page you are now reading is a *banner* layout page!

Standalone Layouts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another kind of alternate layout is the *standalone* layout, which displays
text exactly the same way as the *banner* layout, but it does not separate out
the sections into separate "banners."  The heading fonts and styling
are the same.
